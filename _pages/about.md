<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Welcome to my academic homepage! I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the School of Electronic and Information Engineering at Beihang University, under the guidance of Prof. Hongbo Zhao and Prof. Wenquan Feng. My research focuses on adversarial examples, dataset distillation, and federated learning, aimed at enhancing the robustness and security of machine learning models in various applications.

Prior to my Ph.D. journal, I completed my Master's degree in Electronic Engineering at Shandong University, where I gained expertise in signal processing and machine learning techniques. Under the supervision of Prof. Ju Liu, my Master's thesis investigated the vulnerabilities of machine learning models and strategies to mitigate adversarial attacks. Additionally, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and Automation from Qingdao University of Science and Technology. This interdisciplinary background has equipped me with a diverse skill set and a holistic understanding of engineering principles. 

In addition to my academic and professional endeavors, I am passionate about contributing to the academic community and fostering collaboration among researchers. I actively participate in academic conferences and workshops, where I present my research findings and engage in discussions with fellow scholars. I believe that interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge exchange are essential for driving innovation and addressing complex challenges in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Thank you for visiting my homepage, and I invite you to explore my research interests, publications, and professional achievements. Feel free to contact me if you have any inquiries or opportunities for collaboration. I look forward to connecting with you!

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision.
