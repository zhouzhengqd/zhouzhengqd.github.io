      I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.buaa.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Beihang University</a>. From 2018 to 2023, I worked as an Embedded Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.haier.com/" target="_blank">Haier Group</a> while completing a Master's degree at <a href="https://www.sdu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Shandong University</a>, supervised by <a href="https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/liuju/zh_CN/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. Ju Liu</a>. I previously studied at <a href="https://www.sdu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">TU Ilmenau</a> in Germany and hold a Bachelor's degree from <a href="https://www.qust.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Qingdao University of Science and Technology</a>.
